Research Informatics and Open Science Maturity Model


## Problem statement
CTSAs are the core sources of clinical and translational research, but often struggle with helping their organizations understand the strategic importance of improving its informatics capabilities and IT deployment.  All institutions are trying to understand what they should invest in to remain innovative and competitive, not only in research but in translating knowledge into practice and exploring the data they have to improve health. 

Significant interest in the Maturity Model has already been elicited without a wide call.  We want to democratize this kind of survey so that stakeholders at all levels can self-assess and work to improve their current functions and plan for innovation.



## Project description
Organizations that engage in research, especially those with Clinical and Translational Science groups, may want to self-assess their maturity of key research IT capabilities and learn to improve these capabilities.  This project intends to develop an approach to help organizations through that process.  It builds on other assessments by Embi, Knosp, Barnett, and Anderson by narrowing the focus to key areas related to collaborative and open science, and provides more clarity and context for the possibilities for improvement.  It also intends to facilitate the process of improvement through guided vignettes and tools.

## Repositories

Github repositories associated with the project. Each project requires at least one repository to house the administrative tracking and public information. Please be sure to tag any repositories not under the data2health organization with the topic 'data2health'. Project repositories must be public. Some repositories may be private for sensitivity or operational reasons.

## Deliverables

* Survey version 2.0, ready for administration to a wide audience (including self-assessment).
* Results / benchmarks from 1st twelve administrations.


## Milestones 
The purpose of this survey is to elicit key indicators related to research and translational IT that may drive the ability for institutions to engage in innovative and collaborative open science.  Our definition of research and translational IT are the capabilities that enable data, information, and knowledge to be discovered, processed, and shared.  It focuses on three key areas:
* Governance and Leadership
* Data sharing and licensing
* Deployment of capabilities related to data (architecture, content, tools, and sharing)

The survey has three steps:  

1) data collection for “artifacts” related to our focus areas and open science/collaboration more broadly.  This includes documenting the evidence of tools, policies, governance structures, leadership positions, and resources at a site.

2) Open-ended questions related to governance and leadership, and policies influencing data sharing and licensing.

3) A guided identification of  ‘bright spots’ related to the  deployment of key infrastructure capabilities.   


## Evaluation 
Each project should propose a set of evaluation measures, recorded in a separate Evaluation Plan file, for example [here](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/blob/master/evaluation.md). These will be reviewed by the Evaluation committee and approved by the Program Directors and NCATS. The Evaluation committee will meet with each Project team leads to assist. 

Each project should have Evaluation-realated issues, that can be tagged with the "evaluation" tag. see [Example Evaluation Issue](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/issues/5)

TBD

## Education
Each project should propose a set of educational activities, listed separately in the Education Plan file. 
Please reference any of the following that apply: 
- Educational resources that will be generated (these can be milestones and/or files in the repo)
- Educational opportunities (please indicate for which type of learner and how to participate)
- Best practices guides

Please include education related issues where relevant, tagged with "education". 

TBD

## Get involved
We encourage the community to get involved. 

We require all CD2H projects to have non-CD2H CTSA participants, as CD2H is a CTSA coordinating center. Each project should include an Engagement plan file, example [here](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/blob/master/engagement.md). 

Please tag any engagment related issues with "engagement".

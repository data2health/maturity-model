# Evaluation plan

We will collect the qualitative information from this phase and analyze it and the previous Phase I data to provide a document that outlines the potential maturity model levels.
We will ask for edits and clarifications of the questions for the next version from each collaborator.
We will place the information from the first 12 sites, anonymized and where data is sufficient, into each level for each concept. This will provide an initial comparative distribution of maturity.
We will present a summary of the data from the different sites, organized into identified maturity stages, for feedback to the relevant stakeholders.

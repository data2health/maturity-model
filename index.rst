Welcome to the Informatics Maturity Model Project
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

| The **Research Informatics Open Science Maturity Model** (RIOSM) is a maturity model developed within the `Center for Data to Health <https://github.com/data2health>`_ (CD2H) `Maturity Model <https://github.com/data2health/maturity-model>`_ project. It can be used by organizations for  **self assessment and planning** for organizations needing to advance capabilities in research informatics and open science. 
| Like other maturity and adoption models, it **defines current best practices, pathways to reach them, and organizational practice distributions.**. 
  
Currently the RIOSM has defined models in three areas: 

1. Data Governance
2. Software Licensing 
3. Research IT Deployment

 # Contributing to the Research Informatics and Open Science Maturity Model project # 

Thank you for being interested in the work we are doing. We’re glad you’re here and look forward to your contributions. You don’t need to code to contribute to our project. At present, we are looking for your help in the following areas:
 
* Read [our report](http://bit.ly/RIOSM_pdf), assess your organization, and provide feedback on its use.  This work is based on interviews at 12 organizations. Interviewees included CTSA PIs, informatics chairs, CRIOs, Research IT leads, and key innovators.

If you are interested in participating, and haven’t done so yet, please contact us by sending a message through GitHub.

We look forward to partnering with you!

**Our Community Engagement Plans**

* We will contact all CD2H participants who’ve onboarded and indicated interest in this project, say hi, remind them of our github and direct them here. 
* We will contact people who have indicated interest in our project, but never onboarded. 
* We will communicate about existing maturity models and the ability to access them with a voting mechanism for who would be interested in adopting or assessing these at their own institution.
* We will create a maturity Model 'library' to be shared for review on the [emergent guidebook](https://reusable-data-best-practices.readthedocs.io/en/latest)
* Use Github and other tools to communicate, share work, and collaborate with the above mentioned communities.
* Create documentation and support for the community
* Periodic briefs and/or presentations to key stakeholders

If you have an idea for us to better engage with the community, please let us know. We welcome invitations to share more about the work we’re all doing. Please don’t be shy in inviting us to your meet-up, seminar or conference.

**It means a lot to us that you choose to contribute to this important work. We appreciate you.**

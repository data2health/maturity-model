# Engagement Plan

If you are interested in participating, please [onboard here](http://bit.ly/cd2h-onboarding-form).
You can also begin by reviewing the current [RIOSM model](http://bit.ly/RIOSM_pdf) and assessing your organization, and providing feedback on its use.

## Engagement accomplished:
- We performed Research Informatics and Open Science maturity model assessments on 12 organizations, including Tufts, Cornell, Columbia, OHSU, UW, Nebraska, Washington University, Mt. Sinai, UCSD, Minnesota, UAB and Scripps. Interviewees included CTSA PIs, informatics chairs, CRIOs, Research IT leads, and key innovators at the institutions.
  - We are communicating results and updates to them in advance of the CTSA PI meeting
    
## Ongoing:
- A broad communication about the extant maturity models and the ability to access them with a voting mechanism for who would be interested in adopting or assessing these at their own institution. 
    - Maturity Model 'library' to be shared for review on the [emergent guidebook](https://reusable-data-best-practices.readthedocs.io/en/latest); please [see issue](https://github.com/data2health/maturity-model/issues/27)
- Our work to support other maturity models: 
  - Research and Translational IT maturity model (Knosp, Embi, Anderson, and Barnett) – communication with them ; support for their ongoing work ; feedback ; CD2H will connect users to this model when ready.
  - Precision Medicine (Barnett) – feedback on the initial model
  - EDW4R model (Knosp, Campion) – David Dorr liaison to iDTF subcommittee; we helped interview 2 sites; Dorr helping with analysis and support; will help further connect CTSAs to that work

## Welcome to the Informatics Maturity Model Project

Organizations that engage in research, especially those with Clinical and Translational Science groups, may want to self-assess their maturity of key research IT capabilities and learn to improve these capabilities.  This project intends to develop an approach to help organizations through that process.  It builds on other assessments by Embi, Knosp, Barnett, and Anderson by narrowing the focus to key areas related to collaborative and open science, and provides more clarity and context for the possibilities for improvement.  It also intends to facilitate the process of improvement through guided vignettes and tools.

The purpose of this survey is to elicit key indicators related to research and translational IT that may drive the ability for institutions to engage in innovative and collaborative open science.  Our definition of research and translational IT are the capabilities that enable data, information, and knowledge to be discovered, processed, and shared.  It focuses on three key areas:

* Governance and Leadership
* Data sharing and licensing
* Deployment of capabilities related to data (architecture, content, tools, and sharing)

The survey has three steps:  

1) Data collection for “artifacts” related to our focus areas and open science/collaboration more broadly.  This includes documenting the evidence of tools, policies, governance structures, leadership positions, and resources at a site.

2) Open-ended questions related to governance and leadership, and policies influencing data sharing and licensing.

3) A guided identification of  ‘bright spots’ related to the  deployment of key infrastructure capabilities.

### Federated Data Query Workshop May 20 & 21st, 2019
The Data Harmonization Working Group in CD2H hosted a two-day (May 20-21) workshop in Baltimore on data harmonization and federated query. 
For details about this workshop, including industry subject matter expert presentations, see this link:  [Workshop](https://data2health.github.io/data-harmonization/pages/BaltimoreWorkshop.html)
    

### CDM-FHIR Mappings

Mapping to, from, and among translational research common data models can be greatly facilitated by invoking FHIR as a canonical hub.  An analyis of many existing mapping is updated on this page:  [CDM-FHIR Mappings](pages/CDM-FHIR.md). 

There are many [FHIR Servers options](pages/fhir-repo.md) for FHIR repositories.

* The CDM-FHIR Gap Analaysis Task Team has complied the most [comprehensive mappings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Mrt0xFfvcYhOfoAq_KnT7R5bYk7TZ6h0?usp=sharing) assembled to date. If you know of any other mappings that you do not see here, please add.

### HL7 FHIR Standard Engagement

The CD2H team is engaging the HL7 and FHIR communities around interoperability standards critical to large-scale translational research.  A summary of current activities is here:  [HL7 Engagement and Translational Research Working Group](https://data2health.github.io/data-harmonization/pages/HL7_WG.html)

### Data Harmonization Maturity Model

* The Sustainability and Change Management Task Team has developed a data harmonization maturity model and it is ready for wider CTSA Community input.  Please review and add your feedback to [Data Harmonization Maturity Model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IKKbSxe19ZgayDnv5cqTUzDswNGWQvKZNUc2IgZvaL8/edit?usp=sharing).

### FHIR for Translational Research Blog

Prompted by the recent NIH statement endorsing the use of FHIR for research clinical data, CD2H authored this blog: [Forging Translational Research Networks with FHIR](https://ctsa.ncats.nih.gov/cd2h/blog/forging-translational-research-networks-with-fhir/).

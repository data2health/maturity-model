## Research Informatics Open Science Maturity Model 

The Research Informatics Open Science Maturity Model (RIOSM) is a maturity model developed within the [Center for Data to Health](https://github.com/data2health) (CD2H) [Maturity Model Project](https://github.com/data2health/maturity-model). It can be used by organizations for  **self assessment and planning** for organizations needing to advance capabilities in research informatics and open science. 

Like other maturity and adoption models, it **defines current best practices, pathways to reach them, and organizational practice distributions.**. 
  
Currently the RIOSM has defined models in three areas: 

1. Data Governance
2. Software Licensing 
3. Research IT Deployment

## Existing Models

There are over 30 maturity models that we have identified that are relevant to healthcare, however none of them are in a comprehensive document, until now. We have created a comprehensive list that can used as a reference for your CTSA to learn more about a specific model. Please visit that list [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zj1owDXyIQOijKCeOWUwEZWvjZ4Ka89SMIBMgKFtnmQ).

For further reading on a particular model, please visit [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1DSD_NYqBRJeim05EEbjbPeQnBRdk7rjp) folder. Each reference is labeled by the Maturity Model acroynm where applicable.

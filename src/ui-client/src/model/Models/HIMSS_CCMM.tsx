    description: 'Created to help the optimization of results in health systems and patient satisfaction. The HIMSS Continuity of Care Maturity Model (CCMM) goes beyond Stage 7 of EMRAM. It consists of 7 stages and it is based on the EMRAM structure. This global maturity model addresses the convergence of interoperability, exchange of information, coordination of care, patient involvement. Its goal is the efficient management of health for the whole of the population and also at the individual level. This model also has the ability to assess the implementation and use of IT by the health service providers in order to optimize clinical and financial outcomes. With regard to the benefits of using this model, we can highlight the guidelines for the design of a solid strategy, at national and regional levels. Appropriate measures are taken in a timely manner and include all stakeholders. As an example of these guidelines, we highlight the standardization of: IT systems, privacy, patient involvement, etc.',
